# Field-FX 2024 - A demoparty in a tent at EMF Camp 2024

**Date:** 30th May - 2nd June 2024  
**Location:** Eastnor Park, Ledbury, UK

[demoscene](http://demoscene-the-art-of-coding.net/the-demoscene/), a digital ~~frontier~~ arts subculture, and EMF Camp, a festival for hackers and creative people to gather, party, and share knowledge. We're throwing a demoparty, and everyone at EMF Camp is invited to watch, to make entries, and to have a great time. There's a saying on the scene, "the real party is outside." Well, it doesn't get any more outside than this!

Our goal is to bring the spirit of the demoscene to more people, and to encourage creativity. We hope you will join us!

Anyone who has a ticket to EMF Camp can join us on site. If you want to watch remotely, we will be streaming the event on [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/fieldfxdemo). To submit entries (please submit entries!) we will be announcing our partynet nearer the event. We are not charging for anything, but [EMF tickets](https://www.emfcamp.org/tickets) are sold separately.

# Monday Night Bytes

We have a regular Monday night jam at around 8 or 9pm UK time, on our [twitch channel](https://twitch.tv/FieldFxDemo).

The purpose of the jams is to give people a chance to practice together, without the pressure of a demoparty event. Also, it's a chance to hang out with the scene community and to learn from each other.

We host two types of jam. Byte Jams are the most common - using [TIC-80](https://tic80.com), a fantasy console that facilitates learning and pixel drawing. The other kind is Shader Jams using [Bonzomatic](https://github.com/TheNuSan/Bonzomatic). This uses [GLSL](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Games/Techniques/3D_on_the_web/GLSL_Shaders), which is a powerful GPU language used in computer graphics and game development.

We encourage anyone who wants to try! If you're interested, please let us know, or find out more by following the announcements on our social media channels.
